  <h1 id="the-traditional-way">The traditional way</h1>
<p>The traditional model of publishing involves a Publisher; a Writer (that’s you); an Editor (a real human being); and, more often than not, Microsoft Word. There are many good reasons why a non-technical person would want to write a book in Word:</p>
<h2 id="its-ubiquitous">It’s ubiquitous</h2>
<p>So sharing documents is easy and so is finding a computer with any version of Word installed on it.</p>
<h2 id="publishers-and-editors-expect-it">Publishers and Editors expect it</h2>
<p>It’s What Everyone Uses. So even though you really, really prefer your dinky old copy of WordSTAR — well, tough luck. They want your manuscript in Word anyway.</p>
<h2 id="it-has-a-battery-of-features">It has a battery of features</h2>
<p>And it’s not all bad, either. Spell- and grammar checking is excellent; the track changes and annotation functionality is handy; it’s WYSIWYG, so it’s easy for someone to format; and if you’re fancy, you can even diff documents.</p>
<p>The irony of course is that, once your manuscript’s written, a crack team of Santa’s Helpers spend days extricating your text from Word so they can typeset it in Adobe InDesign. It’s even funnier when you consider that a lot of techie-types will write the book in Markdown, docbook, or reStructuredText only to paste it into Word. But that’s all beside the point. When you write a book on Emacs it would be hypocritical not to use Emacs. Well, it so happens Emacs is the Right Choice for this anyway.</p>
<h1 id="the-emacs-way">The Emacs Way</h1>
<p>When I decided to write the book I wanted it in both ePub and PDF format. My personal preference for technical books is PDF or print. But not everyone shares my enthusiasm for PDF files, so I also had to pick a toolchain that would allow me to output, at the very least, ePub. The most obvious choice is LaTeX. Indeed, the final PDF output is typeset with LaTeX. But LaTeX is a rather baroque, and turing-complete, format; if you stray too far off the beaten path (or if you get too clever) the LaTeX-to-ePub generation would suffer. I’d have to reach in and manually fix things. Knowing how cumbersome mapping one source format to another can be, I decided not to write the book in LaTeX. Ultimately I settled on reStructuredText. As a Python developer I knew it already, and as I have an aversion to Markdown – nobody can seemingly agree on a singular specification for that format – that ruled it out, even though it is far more ubiquitous. So the idea was I’d write the book in reStructuredText and convert it to ePub and LaTeX using Pandoc. Another option is, of course, Org mode. Unfortunately converting Org mode from one format to another made it difficult to work with. I could’ve exported Org mode as HTML, but like LaTeX there are many ways of doing the same thing. Plus, reStructuredText has a clearly-defined specification, and the docutils tool to fall back on if Pandoc failed me. I didn’t want the hassle of switching formats mid-way either, so I went with reStructuredText.</p>

  I use Emacs, which might be thought of as a thermonuclear word processor.

  -- Neal Stephenson, *In the Beginning… was the Command Line*.

In Emacs, there are several modifier keys you can use, each with its own character:

========   =========
Modifier   Full Name
========   =========
``C-``     Control
``M-``     Meta (&quot;Alt&quot; on most keyboards)
``S-``     Shift
========   =========
</code></pre>
<p>Here’s a snapshot of what the reStructuredText looks like. Very clean, and very readable, especially with syntax highlighting.</p>
